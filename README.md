Instructions: 
• Create local SQL relational database with 3 tables, and 10 rows of data per each table. 
• One table is for content (text-based questions with text-based answers). Each row is a 
different question. The first column is the question. The next four columns are the possible 
answers with one being correct. The sixth column is the correct answer. the seventh column 
is an image. The image must be contained inside the database and not be linked to an 
outside image. The eight column is the username who answered the question first. Pick 
usernames from the second table listed below. 
• All questions, answers, and images should be G-Rated. A possible question could be 
something along the lines of "what is the color of the sky in the image? A. Red, B. Blue, C. 
Green, D. Orange," and show the image of the sky. 
• The second table is for user content. The columns are username, first name, last name, 3-
digit number, number of wins, and number of losses. The content can be whatever you like 
but must be G-Rated. 
• The third table is for storing 4-digit codes and internet network names. An example could be 
"4F6I" and "Library_Network_4G." 
• Optimize/Normalize the database if possible. 
• Write SQL code that lists all the users by the number of wins, from highest to lowest
